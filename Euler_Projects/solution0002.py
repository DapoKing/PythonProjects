#my first tboughts are to create an algorithm for the Fibonacci sequence, if there isn't already

#using indexes to change and append lists in a while loop.

#the question is to sum the even valued terms. 

#instead I can just sum the 4th term in an index

#the first even number is in position [1] and the next [5] 

# So I'd just need to keep adding those numbers using sum() to a list that's largest number is less than 4 million

# that less than 4 million part could be included in the while loop
