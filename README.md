# PythonProjects
Using my love for maths and applying my knowledge to solving mathematical problems using Python. 

This is a fun way for me to up my skills and understanding in Python to improve my efficiency in reading and writing scripts as a Threat Intel Analyst. 

Here I share my solutions publically as well as my line of thought, and I am happy to hear more efficient ways I could have arrived at the correct answer.

The link to all the problems is can be found [here](https://www.nayuki.io/page/project-euler-solutions)
